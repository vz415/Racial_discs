    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Alright, looks like there is a p-value of about 5x10^-5, which should be sufficient to assume that there is a difference in the proportion of white sounding names receiving a call-back versus black sounding names. The down-side with the chi-square is the inability to measure the effect size. While I can calculate the phi value, which is defined as the square root of the chi-square statistic divided by the sample size, to assess the effect size, a more straight-forward approach would be to use the odds ratio to measure the effect size."

    "A chi-square test was performed only on a contingency table of the isolated black and white names, and if they received a call-back. With these two variables isolated, we could see that there was a difference between the two groups. To quantify that difference, the odds ratio was calculated, as well as its 95% confidence interval. While the lower bound indicated that a white-sounding name should be more successful by a factor of 1.25, there is still room for doubt. \n",
    "\n",
    "While odds ratios are great at showing the effect size of a proportional representation like this one, it does not take into account confounding factors. There could be a variable within the dataframe that is highly correlated with white-sounding names that happened to increase the rate of call-backs. To pursue this end, I would recommend that future analysis construct a correlation table to find the variables that are highly correlated and investigate whether that confounding factor made a significant difference in increasing the number of call-backs."
